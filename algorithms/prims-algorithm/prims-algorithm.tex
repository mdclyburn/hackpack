Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that allows for finding a minimum spanning tree/forest in $O(E  \log{V})$ time.
Prim's algorithm is implemented by doing the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose an arbitrary unvisited node in the graph.
	\item Grow the tree by choosing the node that can be added to the tree by least cost.
	\item Repeat step 2 until all connected nodes have been visited. If there are still nodes, return to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example Contest Problem: Cow Connection}
Farmer John has expanded his real estate holdings and now owns several farms.
These farms are connected by an old, unmaintained road network. 

At night, these roads are unlit and are very dangerous.
Farmer John wants to improve safety by installing lights along the roads.
However, Farmer John does not have much extra money to spend on this effort.

Help Farmer John determine a minimum cost set of roads that he could light to connect all of the farms by lit roads.
\subsubsection{Input Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1: One integer, $N$, $(N < 1000000)$ specifying the number of paths in the corn field.
\item Line 2..$(N+1)$: Each line contains three integers $S$, $D$ and $C$ where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $S$ and $D$ represent the farm id numbers that a given road connects. $0 \leq S < N$ and $0 \leq D < N$.
		\item $C$ is the cost of lighting that road. $(0 < C < 1000000$
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output Format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Line 1: One integer, representing the minimum cost.
	\item Line 2..$(N+1)$: Two integers, that represent the farms at the end of either road Farmer John should choose to light.
		These integers should be in order from least to greatest.

\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typedefs can greatly improve readability of code
	\item Convenience classes can greatly improve readability
	\item Directed graphs can be converted to undirected graphs by inserting the edge for both the source and the destination.
